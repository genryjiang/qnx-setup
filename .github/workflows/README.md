# Workflows

Please feel free to add workflows. There are many examples in other repositories depending on what you want to achieve.


... but, importantly...

**Please do not use `ubuntu-latest` as your runner**


We will very quickly exhaust the UNSW enterprise free credits if people do this, and will get into trouble.

Please use `runs-on: self-runner` instead. This will use some free AWS machines we have available.
